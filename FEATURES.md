## üí° Pro Tips

### Dashboard Tips:
1. **Use Chat for Quick Queries** - Faster than manual searching
2. **Switch Tabs Frequently** - All data stays loaded
3. **Wallet Analysis First** - Then ask AI about findings

### Whale Tracker Tips:
1. **Start with 1h Range** - Faster loading
2. **Lower Threshold for More Data** - Try $10K instead of $100K
3. **Filter by Chain** - Focus on high-activity chains
4. **Use Token Filter** - Track specific assets like USDC
5. **Check Top Whales** - Identify most active addresses

### Performance Tips:
1. **Fewer Chains = Faster** - Select only chains you need
2. **Shorter Time Ranges** - 1h loads faster than 24h
3. **Higher Thresholds** - Less data to process
4. **Auto-Refresh** - Runs every 5 minutes automatically
